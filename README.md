# Let's Talk About REAPER: DrummerClock
**A high-visibility cinematic region clock for performers and engineers.**

I created this tool because I needed a better way to see my place in a session from behind the drum kit. I am a filmmaker and drummer, not a programmer—this script was developed as a collaboration between my creative vision and Gemini (AI).

### Features
* **Strategic Visuals:** Large, bold region names and countdowns.
* **Traffic Light Progress:** A bar that turns yellow and red based on your custom thresholds.
* **Smart Branding:** Shows your current project name with professional "PROJECT:" labeling.
* **Drummer Friendly:** Keyboard pass-through ensures your spacebar still works for transport while the clock is focused.
* **Customizable:** Right-click the gear icon to set warning beats and visual cues.

### Installation
1. Install the **SWS Extension** and **JS_ReaScriptAPI** via ReaPack.
2. Add my repository URL to ReaPack: `[Insert your GitHub Raw URL here]`
3. Search for "Big Clock" and install.
